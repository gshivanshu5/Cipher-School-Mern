List Branches:

To list all the branches in your Git repository, you can use the git branch command:
Copy code
git branch
Example output:
Create a New Branch:

To create a new branch, you can use the git branch command followed by the branch name:
git branch <new-branch-name>
Example:
git branch my-feature
This command creates a new branch named "my-feature."

Switch to an Existing Branch:

To switch to an existing branch, you can use the git checkout command, as I described in a previous response. However, you can also use git branch to switch branches and list available branches simultaneously:
git branch -checkout <branch-name>
Example:
git branch -checkout feature-branch
This will switch your working directory to the "feature-branch."

Rename a Branch:
To rename an existing branch, you can use the -m option with the git branch command:
git branch -m <new-branch-name>
Example:
git branch -m new-name-for-branch
This renames the current branch to "new-name-for-branch."

Delete a Branch:
To delete a branch, you can use the -d option for a safe delete (it will only delete the branch if all changes are merged), or -D for a force delete (it will delete the branch regardless of merge status):
git branch -d <branch-name>   # Safe delete
git branch -D <branch-name>   # Force delete
Example:
git branch -d feature-branch
This will safely delete the "feature-branch" if it's fully merged. Use -D if you want to delete it forcefully.

List Remote Branches:
To list remote branches, you can use the -r option with the git branch command:
git branch -r
