In HTML, you can use the <ul> (unordered list) and <ol> (ordered list) elements to create lists, and you can use the <li> (list item) element to define individual items within the list. Additionally, you can use the <img> element to display images. Here's how you can use these tags in HTML:

Unordered List (<ul>) and List Item (<li>) for Bulleted Lists:
<ul>
    <li>Item 1</li>
    <li>Item 2</li>
    <li>Item 3</li>
</ul>
This code creates an unordered (bulleted) list with three items. You can change the content of each list item as needed.

Ordered List (<ol>) and List Item (<li>) for Numbered Lists:
<ol>
    <li>First Item</li>
    <li>Second Item</li>
    <li>Third Item</li>
</ol>
This code creates an ordered (numbered) list with three items. The numbers are automatically generated.

Image (<img>) Tag for Displaying Images:
<img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of the image">
In this code, you use the <img> tag to display an image. You specify the source of the image using the src attribute, and you provide a brief description of the image using the alt attribute. The alt attribute is important for accessibility and SEO, as it provides a textual description of the image in case it cannot be displayed.

You can customize these elements further by adding additional attributes and styling through CSS. The examples provided above are basic usage of these HTML tags.
