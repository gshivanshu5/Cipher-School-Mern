CSS pseudo-classes are keywords added to selectors that specify a special state of the selected elements. They allow you to style elements based on various criteria that cannot be expressed with simple selectors. Pseudo-classes are preceded by a colon ":" and can be used to style links, form elements, user interactions, and more.

Here are some common pseudo-classes and their usage:

1. **:hover**: Used to style an element when the user hovers over it with the cursor. For example, changing the color of a link when hovered:
    ```css
    a:hover {
      color: red;
    }
    ```

2. **:active**: Styles an element while it's being activated (clicked) by the user. For instance, changing the background color of a button when clicked:
    ```css
    button:active {
      background-color: #f0f0f0;
    }
    ```

3. **:focus**: Applies styles to an element when it gains focus. Commonly used for form elements like input fields. For instance, changing the border color of a focused input field:
    ```css
    input:focus {
      border-color: blue;
    }
    ```

4. **:nth-child(n)**: Selects elements based on their position in a group of siblings. For example, to style every other row in a table:
    ```css
    tr:nth-child(even) {
      background-color: #f2f2f2;
    }
    ```

5. **:first-child, :last-child**: Styles the first or last child element within its parent. For example, styling the first paragraph within a div:
    ```css
    div p:first-child {
      font-weight: bold;
    }
    ```

6. **:not(selector)**: Styles elements that do not match a specific selector. For example, applying styles to list items that are not the first item:
    ```css
    li:not(:first-child) {
      color: gray;
    }
    ```

7. **:nth-of-type(n)**: Similar to nth-child, but it only selects elements of a specific type (tag name). For instance, styling every third paragraph:
    ```css
    p:nth-of-type(3) {
      font-style: italic;
    }
    ```

These are just a few examples of CSS pseudo-classes. Pseudo-classes offer powerful ways to apply styles to elements based on various conditions and states, enhancing the interactivity and visual appeal of web pages.
