React components are reusable, self-contained building blocks that represent parts of a user interface. They are the fundamental units of a React application, allowing developers to create modular and maintainable code.

There are two main types of React components:

1. **Functional Components:**
   - Also known as stateless components or presentational components.
   - Defined as JavaScript functions that take props (properties) as arguments and return React elements.
   - They don't manage state or have access to lifecycle methods until the introduction of React Hooks.
   - Example:
   ```javascript
   import React from 'react';

   const MyComponent = (props) => {
     return (
       <div>
         <h1>{props.title}</h1>
         <p>{props.description}</p>
       </div>
     );
   };

   export default MyComponent;
   ```

2. **Class Components:**
   - Also known as stateful components or container components.
   - Defined as ES6 classes extending `React.Component` and have a `render()` method that returns the UI.
   - They can have state, lifecycle methods, and perform actions based on component lifecycle events.
   - Example:
   ```javascript
   import React, { Component } from 'react';

   class MyComponent extends Component {
     constructor(props) {
       super(props);
       this.state = {
         count: 0
       };
     }

     render() {
       return (
         <div>
           <p>Count: {this.state.count}</p>
           <button onClick={() => this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 })}>
             Increment
           </button>
         </div>
       );
     }
   }

   export default MyComponent;
   ```

With the introduction of React Hooks, functional components gained more capabilities, allowing them to handle state and lifecycle features through functions like `useState`, `useEffect`, etc., making them a preferred choice in many cases.

Components can also receive data through props and can maintain their internal state. They promote reusability, modularity, and encapsulation in React applications, enabling developers to create complex UIs by composing smaller, manageable pieces.
