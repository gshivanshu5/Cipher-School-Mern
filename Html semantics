HTML semantics refers to the practice of using HTML elements in a way that conveys the meaning and structure of your web content to both browsers and humans. When you create web pages, using semantic HTML elements enhances accessibility, search engine optimization (SEO), and the overall organization of your content. Here are some of the commonly used semantic HTML elements:

1. `<header>`: Represents a container for introductory content or a set of navigational links. Typically found at the top of a page and often contains a logo and the main navigation menu.

2. `<nav>`: Represents a section of a page that contains navigation links, such as menus or lists of links to other parts of the website.

3. `<main>`: Signifies the main content of a document. There should be only one `<main>` element per page.

4. `<article>`: Represents a self-contained composition that could be distributed and understood independently, such as a blog post or a news article.

5. `<section>`: Defines a thematic grouping of content within an HTML document. It's often used to create a hierarchy within an `<article>`.

6. `<aside>`: Contains content that is related to the main content but not part of the main content itself, like a sidebar or a pull quote.

7. `<footer>`: Represents a container for the footer of a section or page. It often contains metadata, copyright information, or contact details.

8. `<figure>` and `<figcaption>`: `<figure>` is used to encapsulate media content (like images, videos, and diagrams), and `<figcaption>` is used to provide a caption or description for the content within `<figure>`.

9. `<time>`: Specifies a specific point in time or a range of time. It's used to mark up dates and times in a machine-readable format.

10. `<em>` and `<strong>`: `<em>` represents emphasized text, typically displayed as italic, while `<strong>` represents strong emphasis, typically displayed as bold.

11. `<abbr>` and `<acronym>`: Used for marking up abbreviations and acronyms with their full, expanded form.

12. `<cite>`: Indicates the title of a creative work (e.g., a book, movie, or article) that is being referenced.

Using semantic HTML elements not only helps browsers and assistive technologies understand your content but also provides a clear structure for search engines, making your web pages more SEO-friendly. Additionally, it improves accessibility for users who rely on screen readers or other assistive technologies, as they can better interpret the content and its relationships.
